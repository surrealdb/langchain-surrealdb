Hi!

This is an example of vector search and graph featuring:

- SurrealDBVectorStore: for similarity/relevance search
- SurrealDBGraph: a langchain graph store
- SurrealDBGraphQAChain: a Question/Answering langchain chain class capable of querying the graph using LLM models

## TODO
- demo the LLMGraphTransformer
