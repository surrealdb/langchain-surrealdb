[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Chloe: GUYS. Have you seen the trailer for 'Apex'? The new F1 movie with Brad Pitt? It looks absolutely insane. ü§Ø
[10/06/2025, 15:24:45] Liam: YES! Was just about to send it here. We have to go see it. I read they used actual F1 cars for filming.
[10/06/2025, 15:25:45] Ben: Oh wow, just watched it. Looks epic. I'm defo in. When are we thinking?
[10/06/2025, 15:26:45] Chloe: It comes out Friday 8th August. We should 100% go that opening weekend.
[10/06/2025, 15:27:45] Chloe: What about Saturday 9th?
[10/06/2025, 15:28:45] Liam: Works for me! Saturday evening?
[10/06/2025, 15:29:45] Ben: Ahhh Saturday is a bit tricky for me, got my sister's birthday dinner. What about the Sunday? Or maybe a weeknight to avoid the crowds?
[10/06/2025, 15:30:45] Chloe: Good point. We could do the Tuesday after it comes out? Tuesday 12th?
[10/06/2025, 15:31:45] Chloe: And we HAVE to see it at the BFI IMAX in Waterloo. Go big or go home, right?
[10/06/2025, 15:32:45] Liam: YES! That screen is the size of a planet. Great shout, Chloe.
[10/06/2025, 15:33:45] Liam: Tuesday works perfectly for me.
[10/06/2025, 15:34:45] Ben: Okay, just checked my calendar. Tuesday 12th is completely free. I'm in! ‚úÖ
[10/06/2025, 15:35:45] Chloe: Excellent! It‚Äôs a date. I'll check showtimes now. Looks like there‚Äôs a 7:45pm showing. Sound good?
[10/06/2025, 15:36:45] Liam: Perfect. Gives us time to grab food beforehand.
[10/06/2025, 15:37:45] Ben: Yeah, good shout. We could grab a bite on the South Bank? I can get to Waterloo for 6pm.
[10/06/2025, 15:38:45] Chloe: Okay, amazing. Plan is set!
[10/06/2025, 15:39:45] Chloe: What: Apex at BFI IMAX üèéÔ∏èüçø
[10/06/2025, 15:40:45] Chloe: When: Tuesday 12th August
[10/06/2025, 15:41:45] Chloe: Time: 7:45pm showing, meet at 6pm for food.
[10/06/2025, 15:42:45] Chloe: I'll book the tickets now before they sell out. Will send you guys a Monzo link! üôè
[10/06/2025, 15:43:45] Liam: You're a legend, Chloe. Can't wait!
[10/06/2025, 15:44:45] Ben: Brilliant. Thanks for organising! This is going to be so good.
[10/06/2025, 15:45:45] Chloe: sends a GIF of Daniel Ricciardo doing a shoey It‚Äôs lights out and away we go! üòâ
[21/07/2025, 12:10:15] Liam: My commute has been upgraded. This book I'm reading is absolutely phenomenal.
[21/07/2025, 12:10:58] Chloe: Oh yeah? What are you reading?
[21/07/2025, 12:11:45] Ben: Let me guess, another one of those massive fantasy books with a map at the front? üòÇ
[21/07/2025, 12:12:31] Liam: It does have a map and it is magnificent! üòÇ It's called 'Warbreaker' by Brandon Sanderson. You guys would actually love it.
[21/07/2025, 12:13:33] Chloe: Sanderson... I've heard of him. Isn't he the guy who writes those massive 10-book series? I'm not sure I have the energy for that kind of commitment lol.
[21/07/2025, 12:14:18] Liam: That's the best part! This one is a standalone novel. So you get the whole epic story in one book. It's the perfect place to start.
[21/07/2025, 12:15:05] Ben: Ok, you've got my attention. What's it about? No spoilers.
[21/07/2025, 12:16:40] Liam: It's hard to explain without giving too much away! But basically, the magic system is based on something called 'BioChromatic Breath'. People have this energy called Breath, and the more you have, the more powerful you are. You can use it to animate objects and see colours more vividly. It's just so unique.
[21/07/2025, 12:17:15] Liam: Plus there's a talking sword, political intrigue between two kingdoms, and a god who doesn't believe in his own religion.
[21/07/2025, 12:18:02] Chloe: A talking sword? Okay, that sounds pretty cool not gonna lie. And a god with an existential crisis? üòÇ
[21/07/2025, 12:18:49] Ben: Haha sold. Is it on Kindle? I need something new for my holiday next month.
[21/07/2025, 12:19:35] Liam: It is, but even better - Sanderson actually offers it for free as an ebook on his website. He's a legend. Just Google 'Warbreaker free ebook'.
[21/07/2025, 12:20:11] Chloe: Wait, seriously? For free? Okay, I'm downloading it. No excuse not to try it now. Thanks for the recommendation!
[21/07/2025, 12:20:54] Ben: Wow, nice one. Downloading it now too. We can start a mini book club.
[21/07/2025, 12:21:30] Liam: YES! Let me know what you think when you get into it. Prepare to lose a few evenings... in a good way. üòâ
[21/07/2025, 19:20:11] Ben: Random question for a Monday night... but what's everyone's actual, number one, desert island favourite food?
[21/07/2025, 19:20:54] Liam: Ooh, tough one. So many contenders.
[21/07/2025, 19:21:38] Liam: I think I'd have to go with a proper Sunday roast. Like my mum's. Roast beef, crispy roast potatoes, massive Yorkshire puddings, swimming in gravy. Can't be beaten.
[21/07/2025, 19:22:15] Chloe: That's a strong choice, Liam. Very respectable.
[21/07/2025, 19:23:04] Chloe: For me... it has to be a really good, authentic Pad Thai. The perfect balance of sweet, sour, and salty. With loads of peanuts and chilli flakes. ü§§
[21/07/2025, 19:23:45] Ben: Both excellent choices. Liam, you can't go wrong with a roast. Chloe, good shout, a proper Pad Thai is a game changer.
[21/07/2025, 19:24:08] Ben: I was watching Chef's Table and now I'm starving haha.
[21/07/2025, 19:24:51] Liam: So what's yours then, Mr. Question Man?
[21/07/2025, 19:25:39] Ben: For me, it's gotta be pizza. But specifically, a Neapolitan margarita. The simple ones are the best. Chewy, charred crust, proper San Marzano tomatoes, and buffalo mozzarella. Perfection.
[21/07/2025, 19:26:18] Chloe: Ah, a man of taste. You're right, a simple margarita from a proper place is heaven.
[21/07/2025, 19:27:05] Liam: Okay, this conversation has just made me incredibly hungry.
[21/07/2025, 19:27:33] Ben: Right? We should do a food tour of our favourites. There's that pub in Islington that does an amazing roast, Chloe you must know a good Thai place, and I know the best pizza spot in Peckham.
[21/07/2025, 19:28:10] Chloe: I love that idea! The Thai place near me in Highbury is incredible. Let's actually plan it.
[21/07/2025, 19:28:44] Liam: 100%. For now though, I'm ordering a curry. This chat broke me.
[22/07/2025, 00:01:15] Chloe: Are you guys awake? I‚Äôve gone down a rabbit hole of articles about AI and now I‚Äôm genuinely freaked out.
[22/07/2025, 00:01:58] Chloe: It feels like we're sleepwalking into a Skynet situation and nobody seems to care.
[22/07/2025, 00:02:45] Ben: Lol, deep thoughts for midnight on a Monday. What set you off? Did you watch The Terminator again?
[22/07/2025, 00:03:31] Chloe: Not even joking! I was reading about how fast it's developing. We're giving it control of more and more critical systems. It just feels... risky.
[22/07/2025, 00:04:28] Liam: I get why you'd think that, Chloe. The headlines are designed to be scary. But it's not quite a Skynet scenario.
[22/07/2025, 00:05:15] Liam: Most of what we call 'AI' now are just incredibly complex algorithms designed for specific tasks. They aren't 'thinking' or 'conscious'. They're just very, very good at pattern matching.
[22/07/2025, 00:06:05] Chloe: But what about when it gets smarter? What about all the jobs it will replace? That's a real-world thing happening now, not some distant sci-fi future.
[22/07/2025, 00:07:11] Ben: Yeah, I do worry about the jobs part sometimes. But then I remember I can't even get my smart speaker to play the right song half the time. I think we're safe from a robot uprising for a bit.
[22/07/2025, 00:08:24] Liam: Ben's got a point, haha. There are real concerns, for sure, especially around ethics and job displacement. But it's more like the industrial revolution than the apocalypse. Some jobs go, but new ones are created. We just need to adapt.
[22/07/2025, 00:09:01] Liam: It's a powerful tool. Like fire. You can cook your dinner with it or you can burn your house down. It's all about how we manage it.
[22/07/2025, 00:10:18] Chloe: Hmm. The 'managing it' part is what worries me. I'm not sure I trust the people in charge to manage it properly.
[22/07/2025, 00:11:04] Ben: Can we just ask AI to fix the London housing market? If it can do that, I'll welcome our new robot overlords.
[22/07/2025, 00:11:59] Liam: üòÇ There you go. Focus on the positives. AI helping with medical diagnoses, climate change modelling, solving impossible maths problems...
[22/07/2025, 00:12:46] Chloe: Okay, okay. You've calmed me down a bit. I guess. Still feels like we're opening Pandora's Box.
[22/07/2025, 00:13:30] Ben: Time to close the rabbit hole and get some sleep, Chloe. The robots can take over tomorrow. It's past their bedtime too.
[22/07/2025, 00:14:05] Chloe: Haha, alright. Thanks guys. Sorry for the late night existential dread.
[22/07/2025, 00:14:25] Liam: Any time! Go get some rest.
