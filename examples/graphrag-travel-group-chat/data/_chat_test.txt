[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Chloe: GUYS. Have you seen the trailer for 'Apex'? The new F1 movie with Brad Pitt? It looks absolutely insane. ü§Ø
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Liam: YES! Was just about to send it here. We have to go see it. I read they used actual F1 cars for filming.
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Ben: Oh wow, just watched it. Looks epic. I'm defo in. When are we thinking?
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Chloe: It comes out Friday 8th August. We should 100% go that opening weekend.
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Chloe: What about Saturday 9th?
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Liam: Works for me! Saturday evening?
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Ben: Ahhh Saturday is a bit tricky for me, got my sister's birthday dinner. What about the Sunday? Or maybe a weeknight to avoid the crowds?
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Chloe: Good point. We could do the Tuesday after it comes out? Tuesday 12th?
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Chloe: And we HAVE to see it at the BFI IMAX in Waterloo. Go big or go home, right?

[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Liam: Tuesday works perfectly for me.

[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Liam: Perfect. Gives us time to grab food beforehand.
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Ben: Yeah, good shout. We could grab a bite on the South Bank? I can get to Waterloo for 6pm.
[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Chloe: Okay, amazing. Plan is set!
