[10/06/2025, 15:23:45] Chloe: GUYS. Have you seen the trailer for 'Apex'? The new F1 movie with Brad Pitt? It looks absolutely insane. ü§Ø
[10/06/2025, 15:24:45] Liam: YES! Was just about to send it here. We have to go see it. I read they used actual F1 cars for filming.
[10/06/2025, 15:25:45] Ben: Oh wow, just watched it. Looks epic. I'm defo in. When are we thinking?
[10/06/2025, 15:26:45] Chloe: It comes out Friday 8th August. We should 100% go that opening weekend.
[10/06/2025, 15:27:45] Chloe: What about Saturday 9th?
[10/06/2025, 15:28:45] Liam: Works for me! Saturday evening?
[10/06/2025, 15:29:45] Ben: Ahhh Saturday is a bit tricky for me, got my sister's birthday dinner. What about the Sunday? Or maybe a weeknight to avoid the crowds?
[10/06/2025, 15:30:45] Chloe: Good point. We could do the Tuesday after it comes out? Tuesday 12th?
[10/06/2025, 15:31:45] Chloe: And we HAVE to see it at the BFI IMAX in Waterloo. Go big or go home, right?
[10/06/2025, 15:32:45] Liam: YES! That screen is the size of a planet. Great shout, Chloe.
[10/06/2025, 15:33:45] Liam: Tuesday works perfectly for me.
[10/06/2025, 15:34:45] Ben: Okay, just checked my calendar. Tuesday 12th is completely free. I'm in! ‚úÖ
[10/06/2025, 15:35:45] Chloe: Excellent! It‚Äôs a date. I'll check showtimes now. Looks like there‚Äôs a 7:45pm showing. Sound good?
[10/06/2025, 15:36:45] Liam: Perfect. Gives us time to grab food beforehand.
[10/06/2025, 15:37:45] Ben: Yeah, good shout. We could grab a bite on the South Bank? I can get to Waterloo for 6pm.
[10/06/2025, 15:38:45] Chloe: Okay, amazing. Plan is set!
[10/06/2025, 15:39:45] Chloe: What: Apex at BFI IMAX üèéÔ∏èüçø
[10/06/2025, 15:40:45] Chloe: When: Tuesday 12th August
[10/06/2025, 15:41:45] Chloe: Time: 7:45pm showing, meet at 6pm for food.
[10/06/2025, 15:42:45] Chloe: I'll book the tickets now before they sell out. Will send you guys a Monzo link! üôè
[10/06/2025, 15:43:45] Liam: You're a legend, Chloe. Can't wait!
[10/06/2025, 15:44:45] Ben: Brilliant. Thanks for organising! This is going to be so good.
[10/06/2025, 15:45:45] Chloe: sends a GIF of Daniel Ricciardo doing a shoey It‚Äôs lights out and away we go! üòâ
[21/07/2025, 12:10:15] Liam: My commute has been upgraded. This book I'm reading is absolutely phenomenal.
[21/07/2025, 12:10:58] Chloe: Oh yeah? What are you reading?
[21/07/2025, 12:11:45] Ben: Let me guess, another one of those massive fantasy books with a map at the front? üòÇ
[21/07/2025, 12:12:31] Liam: It does have a map and it is magnificent! üòÇ It's called 'Warbreaker' by Brandon Sanderson. You guys would actually love it.
[21/07/2025, 12:13:33] Chloe: Sanderson... I've heard of him. Isn't he the guy who writes those massive 10-book series? I'm not sure I have the energy for that kind of commitment lol.
[21/07/2025, 12:14:18] Liam: That's the best part! This one is a standalone novel. So you get the whole epic story in one book. It's the perfect place to start.
[21/07/2025, 12:15:05] Ben: Ok, you've got my attention. What's it about? No spoilers.
[21/07/2025, 12:16:40] Liam: It's hard to explain without giving too much away! But basically, the magic system is based on something called 'BioChromatic Breath'. People have this energy called Breath, and the more you have, the more powerful you are. You can use it to animate objects and see colours more vividly. It's just so unique.
[21/07/2025, 12:17:15] Liam: Plus there's a talking sword, political intrigue between two kingdoms, and a god who doesn't believe in his own religion.
[21/07/2025, 12:18:02] Chloe: A talking sword? Okay, that sounds pretty cool not gonna lie. And a god with an existential crisis? üòÇ
[21/07/2025, 12:18:49] Ben: Haha sold. Is it on Kindle? I need something new for my holiday next month.
[21/07/2025, 12:19:35] Liam: It is, but even better - Sanderson actually offers it for free as an ebook on his website. He's a legend. Just Google 'Warbreaker free ebook'.
[21/07/2025, 12:20:11] Chloe: Wait, seriously? For free? Okay, I'm downloading it. No excuse not to try it now. Thanks for the recommendation!
[21/07/2025, 12:20:54] Ben: Wow, nice one. Downloading it now too. We can start a mini book club.
[21/07/2025, 12:21:30] Liam: YES! Let me know what you think when you get into it. Prepare to lose a few evenings... in a good way. üòâ
